# Chip's Challenge - AI Planning Agent

This project uses an AI planning algorithm, task prioritization, and subgoals to beat various Chip's Challenge levels. 
The agent is able to make decisions and move dynamically based on proximity to collectable objects necessary to complete levels as well as obstacles
that must be avoided.
